	<h1>Trump as Goldstein</h1>
	
	<center><p><em>"The babes discuss people, the academics study events and the sages explore ideas"</em></p></center>
	
	<p>Goldstein is a character from George Orwel's '1984', designed by 'The Party', so called, to be hated by the obediant citizens and to be loved by those who want to resist, as part of a secret movement known as 'The Brotherhood'. In reality, it's the party, and not Goldstein that torture and kill, and the Brotherhood is a myth. It's just a means of rounding up dissentors so that they can be taken to the Ministry of Love. As a result of this, no matter what opinion you have on Goldstein, whether it be evil rebel or undercover saviour - you're wrong.</p>
	
	<p>I think that the ideas surrounding trump paralell those surrounding Goldstein precisely, it seems like any rational conversation about trump essentially ends up, due to media conditioning, as 'orange man bad' or 'orange man good'. This false dichotomy can be avoided by actually discussing the events but moreso the ideas connoted with the 'orange man', or better, pretending like there are no figureheads at all.</p>
