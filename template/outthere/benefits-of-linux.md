# Benefits of using linux

## Linux:

* Uses less memory.
* Doesn't do automatic updates.
* Has better command line utilities, which are often quicker to use than their graphical couterparts.
The list is endless.
* More customisable in that:
	* You can change what the GUI looks like.
	See: [GNOME](https://gnome.org), [XFCE](https://xfce.org), [KDE](https://kde.org) and [more](https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-linux-desktop-environment-reviewed-and-compared/).
	* You can use scripts to automate basic tasks.
* Is less bloated in that:
	* It doesn't send telemetry data to Microsoft.
	If you care about privacy, don't use Windows.
	* It doesn't waste your resources with an 'antivirus' that you'll never use.
	* It puts more emphasis on plain text files.
* Is quicker to start up, even with a hard drive.

Most people only need to browse the web and access their documents.
Activities like these can be done on linux (obviously) without the Micro$oft crud.

So unless you're a gamer, switching to linux is be a good choice.
Even at that, there are ways of playing windows games on linux, namely with [wine](https://winehq.org) and the Steam-backed [proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/).
