	<p>I want to address the (few) tech nerds out there who identify with their usage of technology. If you would commit to your git repositiory before committing to a sleep schedule, then this is the article for you! Hopefully after reading through my uneducated musings, you'll have the motivation to do something non-techy, though, I can't promise anything. I'll talk about why anybody would want to sacrifice technology and what steps you can take after deciding that the switch has merit.</p>
	
	<h4>But I love using computers. NO! You can't take them away from me! NOOOO—</h4>
	<p>Shh shh. O ye of little faith. Your defensive mechanisms activate at the mere prospect of relinquishing your techy identity. Too much skin in the game eh? Do you value yourself based on how much knowledge you've let pass through those glass windows? Perhaps, had all this dissapeared, you'd see yourself as lacking, inadequate even. Of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6_GvT42IW0">it's not like the electrical grid is at risk of being annihilated or anything</a>, so what's my point?</p>
	
	<h4>What is your point? To each their own, right?</h4>
	<p>At the most fundamental level, if you pass the time you have each day doing this one thing - you'll never reach your full potential. Being well versed in computers and engineering, it's likely that you're not a social media zombie: withtout a doubt, your dedication is to be commended. The problem is investing all of that energy into one area. When you start trying new things: learning history, cooking, gardening, woodworking, playing sports .etc, you'll realise that that enjoyment that you were seeking in code could also be found in so many different areas of life.</p>
	
	<h4>I don't know. That sounds pretty cliché. I'm happy, and this "full potential" thing is too etheral to be considered by my rational brain.</h4>
	<p>Ok, heres where it gets tricky. Unless you've escaped from area-51, some semblance of satisfaction is what you'll naturally gravitate towards. You're essentially using tech to plug that hole: and what a fitting block technology is, with it's near unlimited possibilities. However, as I've said, you may also be ruining you sleep schedule (resulting in fights with the compiler), your back, and your eyes as well as your social prospects, not to mention, once again, that you're depriving yourself of other sources of fulfullment that may be as good, or even better than technology. Let me give you an example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=148r0UVQBxU">this man</a>. This guy is a wise in the ways of bits, just like you. But he's also expanded into so much other areas. He can cook, he has a garden and he engages in sports. All that on top of his programming prowess. Imagine going to sleep knowing that you've taken good care of your health, and eaten food that YOU grew in YOUR own garden! I'll tell ya, if I was living a life like that, not even c++ template errors could phase me.</p>
	
	<h4>Alright, supposing I were to set out to become like this lad, how would I start</h4>
	<p>Here's the great thing. It doesn't even take that much energy to start the shift. Here's a golden pice of advice: remove, don't add. What I mean by that is, rather than trying to fit a homemade 3 course meal at 12:01 AM after you finish tinkering, shave down your tinker time. You'll find yourself with more time on your hands, with which you can sleep (what better practice?), or, if you have enough energy (which you probably don't), go a ahead and break out! Make that meal! Plant those broad beans! 1v1 the local basketball legend. Go to sleep knowing that even if all the technology you've used were to be erased the next morning, the world would remain yours to explore and interact with.</p>
